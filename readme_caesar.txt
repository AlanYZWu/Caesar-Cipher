 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
**********************************************************************
The hardest problem I encountered was during the part where we first started
using command line arguments. It wasn't any like coding issue, but I had trouble
understanding what I was supposed to code for that section. It took me a while 
to realize that encrypt and decrypt weren't trying to call functions and I needed
to put things into the main function that took in those as strings and then
called the function.




**********************************************************************
 *  What are the benefits of using functions?                   
**********************************************************************
Functions make it so that you don't constantly need to repeat yourself by writing 
the same pieces of code over and over again. This makes your code neater and easier
to read and understand.




**********************************************************************
 *  What are any flaws you can come up with regarding the use of a
 *  Caesar Cipher to store sensitive data?                 
**********************************************************************
There is a known and not very difficult way of cracking a Caesar Cipher.



**********************************************************************
 *  Encrypt the following message with a key value of G, write the 
 *  output below:
 *  "No one is so brave that he is not disturbed by something 
 *	unexpected"
**********************************************************************
TU UTK OY YU HXGBK ZNGZ NK OY TUZ JOYZAXHKJ HE YUSKZNOTM ATKDVKIZKJ




**********************************************************************
 *  Crack encrypted_message and output the first line of the 
    decrypted message below
**********************************************************************
LET US GO THEN, YOU AND I,






 **********************************************************************
 *  Please list all help, collaboration, and outside resources
 *  you used here. 
 *
 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."
 **********************************************************************
I asked someone what their TA told them about whether or not we were allowed to call
functions from other functions and then I didn't even end up using what they told me.

 *  List any other comments here
